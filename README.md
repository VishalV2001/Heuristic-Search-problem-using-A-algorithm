# Heuristic Search Problem Using A* Algorithm

## Overview
Finding the best routes in any given environment is a perennial problem with many applications in computer science. This report explores the A* algorithm, a powerful combination of Dijkstra's and Greedy Best-First Search. It explains the algorithm's workings and provides examples of how well it can navigate mazes, with a focus on the particular issue statement.

## A* Algorithm
A* is praised for its heuristic-guided efficiency, making it ideal for situations when computing resources are limited. This study examines the inner workings of A* and its application in maze-solving, particularly focusing on discovering the shortest path from the starting point (0,0) to the destination (4,5) in a maze of 5 x 6 nodes. Allowed moves are Left, Right, Up, and Down. Boundaries serve as impenetrable barriers, while red nodes indicate walls.

## Key Characteristics
- **Maze Representation**: Nodes are represented in a 5 x 6 grid.
- **Allowed Moves**: Left, Right, Up, and Down.
- **Obstacles**: Boundaries and red nodes (walls) serve as barriers.
- **Heuristic Function**: Critical for guiding the search and making decisions.

## Exploration and Visualization
- **Visual Representation**: Creating a visual representation of the maze.
- **Tracking Nodes**: Keeping track of tried nodes during the search.
- **Search Pathways**: Visualizing search pathways to understand the A* algorithm's efficiency.

## Results
The study demonstrates that A* is a reliable way to navigate the given maze's dimensions and boundaries, successfully finding the shortest path from the starting point to the destination.
